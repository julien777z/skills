# SQLAlchemy Rules

## Table Definitions

- Tables use SQLAlchemy 2.0 declarative models and inherit from the project's shared declarative base classes.
- Define `__tablename__` and `__table_args__` explicitly for each table.
- Use `Mapped[T]` + `mapped_column(...)` for all columns.
- Prefer schema-qualified foreign keys with typed configuration values (for example, `ForeignKey(f"{CONFIG.DATABASE_SCHEMA_NAME}.resources.id")`).

```python
import uuid
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

from sqlalchemy import ForeignKey, UniqueConstraint
from sqlalchemy.orm import Mapped, mapped_column, relationship

from myapp.core.config import CONFIG

from . import Base

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from .authors import Author


class Post(Base):
    __tablename__ = "posts"
    __table_args__ = (
        UniqueConstraint("blog_id", "slug", name="uq_post_blog_slug"),
        {"schema": CONFIG.DATABASE_SCHEMA_NAME},
    )

    author_id: Mapped[uuid.UUID] = mapped_column(
        ForeignKey(f"{CONFIG.DATABASE_SCHEMA_NAME}.authors.id"),
        index=True,
    )
    author: Mapped["Author"] = relationship(lazy="selectin")
```

## Relationships

- Use `TYPE_CHECKING` imports and string annotations to avoid circular imports.
- Default relationship loading should be `lazy="selectin"` to avoid N+1 query patterns.
- Keep relationship configuration explicit (`back_populates`, `cascade`, `foreign_keys`) when needed.

## Query Methods

Prefer the project's shared ORM helpers for common reads, pagination, counts, inserts, upserts, and updates when they exist.

- **Important**: when the project's persistence helpers treat bare `None` as omitted, use the project's explicit SQL-NULL sentinel to persist `NULL` on nullable columns.
- Use a single-row update path when changing one loaded entity and a bulk-update path only when one statement intentionally updates multiple matching rows.
- Do not refresh an entity merely to repair stale state after a persistence helper that already updates and flushes the loaded instance.
- Do not manually mutate ORM entity attributes and flush when the repository provides a persistence helper for that operation.
- Avoid manual `session.execute(...)` query construction in service code for standard CRUD/filter flows (including hand-built `select(...).join(...).where(...)` statements).
- Prefer adding or extending reusable query helpers on the project's shared ORM base when a new operation is needed (for example, join-aware lookup helpers) and then consume that helper from services.
- Use direct/manual `session.execute(...)` only for advanced operations that are not practical to express via existing shared helpers.

## Session and Transaction Boundaries

- Route handlers should depend on the project's database-session dependency.
- Route handlers must not perform ORM reads or writes or build response models from ORM rows inline; that data access belongs in a service function that returns the response model.
- Service functions should accept `AsyncSession` and never create their own DB sessions.
- Do not call `commit()` inside service functions; request/session lifecycle owns transaction completion.
- **A commit boundary is the one exception.** When a write must land on a transaction of its own — an audit or compliance record that has to survive the caller rolling back — it cannot join the caller's session, and neither can the rows it references. Such a helper opens its own session, performs that one write, commits, and returns; it deliberately takes no caller session, because the caller's open transaction is precisely what it must not join.
- A row another transaction commits independently is invisible to it until the writer commits, so a foreign key pointing at a row the caller has written but not yet committed fails. Commit that parent row through its own commit boundary before starting the work whose separate transaction references it.
- Name a commit boundary for the guarantee it provides rather than the mechanics, keep it to the single write it exists for, and reach for one only when the dependent write genuinely cannot share the caller's transaction. Everything else keeps the caller's session and lets the request lifecycle commit.

## Postgres Types and Time Handling

- Use PostgreSQL-specific types where needed (`JSONB`, `ARRAY`, SQLAlchemy `Enum`).
- Use timezone-aware timestamp columns (`DateTime(timezone=True)`) for event/timeline fields.
- Use UTC datetimes for application timestamps (`datetime.now(UTC)`).

## Gotchas

- Do not use SQLModel-only APIs (`table=True`, `Field(...)`, SQLModel `Relationship(...)`) in this codebase.
- All service surfaces should centralize transaction lifecycle in their database-session dependency.
- When adding filters/upserts, align with existing `where` clause patterns and class helper methods instead of bespoke query flows.
